# A MERN Stack URL Shortener

# User Stories

As a user,
so I can save characters for tweeting,
I can input a long URL to generate a short URL

As a user,
so I can't tweet dead links,
I can't input an invalid URL

As a user,
if I input the same link more than once,
I'll receive the same short URL

As a user,
I can see the number of times a short URL has been visited
